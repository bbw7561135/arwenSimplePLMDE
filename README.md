# ARWEN PLMDE

----

This is a simple bare-bones CFD code for solving the Euler equations using an unsplit PLMDE method. It is written in C and is 2nd order accurate, and runs on a serial processor.

## Overview

The current code supports the following features:

1. Compressible adiabatic hydrodynamics in 1D, 2D and 3D.
2. 3D cartesian (XYZ), 2D cylindrical (ZRP), and 1D spherical (RTP) grid geometries.

Output is via ASCII or FITS files. The latter requires linking with the FITS library.
